__Signs for Trucks__ is an online store to buy pre-designed vinyls with custom lines of letters (often call truck letterings).
The store also allows clients to upload their own designs and to customize them on the website as well.

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.12.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Developer-Akademie-DevSecOpsKurs/truck-signs-api.git
cd truck-signs-api
```

2. Copy the content of the example.env file into a .env file:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

3. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv <venv_name>
```

4. Activate virtual environment:
```bash
source <venv_name>/scripts/activate
```

5. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Migrate database:
```bash
python src/manage.py makemigrations
python src/manage.py migrate
```

7. Collect static files:
```bash
python src/manage.py collectstatic
```

8. Start the Python Development Server:
```bash
python src/manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

### Settings

The `settings.py` folder inside the `src/tsa_app` folder contains the different settings configuration for the application.

The `example.env` file in the project root contains an overview about configuration values that can be set for the app.

### Models

Most of the models do what can be inferred from their name. The following dots are notes about some of the models to make clearer their propose:
- __Category Model:__ The category of the vinyls in the store. It contains the title of the category as well as the basic properties shared among products that belong to a same category. For example, _Truck Logo_ is a category for all vinyls that has a logo of a truck plus some lines of letterings (note that the vinyls are instances of the model _Product_). Another category is _Fire Extinguisher_, that is for all vinyls that has a logo of a fire extinguisher.
- __Lettering Item Category:__ This is the category of the lettering, for example: _Company Name_, _VIM NUMBER_, ... Each has a different pricing.
- __Lettering Item Variations:__ This contains a foreign key to the __Lettering Item Category__ and the text added by the client.
- __Product Variation:__ This model has the original product as a foreign key, plus the lettering lines (instances of the __Lettering Item Variations__ model) added by the client.

### Brief Explanation of the Views

Most of the views are CBV imported from _rest_framework.generics_, and they allow the backend api to do the basic CRUD operations expected, and so they inherit from the _ListAPIView_, _CreateAPIView_, _RetrieveAPIView_, ..., and so on.

The behavior of some of the views had to be modified to address functionalities such as creation of order and payment, as in this case, for example, both functionalities are implemented in the same view, and so a _GenericAPIView_ was the view from which it inherits. Another example of this is the _UploadCustomerImage_ View that takes the vinyl template uploaded by the clients and creates a new product based on it.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone <INSERT URL>
    cd truck-signs-api
    ```
1. Configure a virtual env
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
1. Configure the environment variables.
    1. Copy the content of the `example.env` file that is on projects root level into a `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp example.env .env
        ```
    2. The new `.env` file should contain all the environment variables necessary to run all the django app in all the environments. However, the only needed variables for the development environment to run are the following:
        ```bash
        SECRET_KEY
        DB_NAME
        DB_USER
        DB_PASSWORD
        DB_HOST
        DB_PORT
        EMAIL_HOST_USER
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
        ```
    3. For the `postgres` database, the default configuration should be:
        ```bash
        DB_NAME=trucksigns_db
        DB_USER=trucksigns_user
        DB_PASSWORD=supertrucksignsuser!
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=5432
        ```
    4. The SECRET_KEY is the django secret key. To generate a new one see: [Stackoverflow Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41298963/is-there-a-function-for-generating-settings-secret-key-in-django)

    5. The `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and the `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` are the credentials to send emails from the website when a client makes a purchase. This is currently disable, but the code to activate this can be found in views.py in the create order view as comments. Therefore, any valid email and password will work.
1. Run the migrations:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py makemigrations
    python src/manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Collect static files:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py collectstatic
    ```
1. Run the app:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py runserver
    ```
1. (Optional step) To create a super user run:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
1. (Optional step) Set up the database. [Django database setup example](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Congratulations =) !!! The App should be running in [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

> [!NOTE]
> To create Truck vinyls with Truck logos in them, first create the __Category__ Truck Sign,
> and then the __Product__ (can have any name). This is to make sure the frontend retrieves
> the Truck vinyls for display in the Product Grid as it only fetches the products of the
> category Truck Sign.
